        FromMy<span className="text-[#ff3333]">Silence</span> is a platform —
        heavily inspired by The Unsent Project — where users can freely share a
        message meant for someone special or just any message/note at all.
        Intended as a bulletin board shared with the entire world, your message
        will land to someone that it's meant for, or maybe not at all.
        <br />
        <br />
        Whether you want to express something that's been on your mind, share a
        story you can't tell elsewhere, or send a message to someone by name,
        FromMySilence provides a space where you can do so without revealing who
        you are. This platform is designed for those moments when you need to
        let something out but prefer to stay anonymous.

        About The Developer
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-2 text-center font-mono text-lg">
        Hello, my name is Thommy and I created FromMy
        <span className="text-[#ff3333]">Silence</span> because I love jotting
        down whatever I had in mind! I have journals and memopads of endless
        thoughts, and I wanted to create a place to show my love of writing
        small things. In high school, I came upon The Unsent Project and thought
        it was such a facinating idea. The simplicity of anonymity and lack of
        likes/comments is what drew me. I came across many platforms alike, and
        found that there's nothing like writing something for it to be forgotted
        or recovered.
        <br />
        <br /> I hope you enjoy writing and reading these little notes as much
        as I did creating this, and <br />
        <span className="font-bold">
          thank you for trusting FromMy
          <span className="text-[#ff3333]">Silence</span> with your thoughts and
          messages.
        </span>
