# FromMySilence

**FromMySilence** is a minimalist web app inspired by [The Unsent Project](https://theunsentproject.com/), offering users a space to share anonymous messages directed to specific names or recipients. It acts as a digital wall for unspoken thoughts, feelings, and memories â€” all stored, displayed, and shared with simplicity in mind.
